Magnum is a big integer library for Vim plugins written entirely in Vim script. Currently it provides just a small set of predicates, arithmetic, and conversion operations. It also includes a simple random number generator.

Complete documentation is included and can be accessed via ":h magnum".

Additional materials (usage examples, test suite, references) are available at the plugin home on GitHub.
